All our Webcampak are ventilated and heated (thermostat) to ensure internal components will not have to deal with extreme temperatures.

As you may be aware there has been a major cold wave over Europe at the beginning of February, it gaves us a confirmation that our systems behave properly in the real production world.

We also install insulation on some of our system (especially in mountains), to help the system cope with extreme weather conditions.

Below is an example of one of our test systems equipped with extra insulation.

As you can see, internal temperature never drop below 10°C, "waves" are created by the automated heating system. You can also notice that humidity drop to zero % at the end of each heating cycles.

As always if you have any questions or if you would like more details just let us know.
