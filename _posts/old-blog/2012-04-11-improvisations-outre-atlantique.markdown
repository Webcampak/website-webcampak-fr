And results can sometimes be surprising, such as the solution detailed in this blog post. Our contact has found a weatherproof toolbox giving him a really inexpensive enclosure for his camera (around 30$).

A fan filter has been installed, slightly protected from weather conditions, white cable is the power cable, the small cable is for weather sensors.

As you can see on the frontside view, glass window is still missing.

Those two pictures from the inside show a Canon camera, installed on a rail system. Apparently the installation can accomodate 250mm+ lens, right under the camera there is a filter (from a kitchen oven) with holes under to allow fresh air to come inside the box. On the second picture you can see the fan, extracting air from the enclosure.

On this last picture you can see electric components, powering inside equipments.
