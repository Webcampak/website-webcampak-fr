Today, we'll give you a few additionnal details about internal components of our Webcampak devices. Each product (except Webcampak-pro) is equipped with a custom integrated electronic board built upon our customers requirements.

We initially integrated this solution to allow power-cycling of the camera in case of error. Webcampak are usually installed on top of masts or in remote locations which makes physical access to the power switch difficult.

We are also installing sensors within our Webcampak. Values from those sensors are processed and displayed as a graph within Webcampak viewer panel. It let our customers know at any time what was the status of those sensors (such as temperature, pressure, humidity, ...).

We could for example capture pictures only in some conditions (such as light, on/off sensors, ...).

Just send us your suggestions and we'll let you know if we can implement it for you.
